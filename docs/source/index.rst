   contain the root `toctree` directive.

[Unmaintained] IPywidgets server
================================

IPywidgets server is no longer maintained. To serve widgets and rich
outputs, we recommend using `voila
<https://github.com/QuantStack/voila>`_ instead. See `this issue
<https://github.com/pbugnion/ipywidgets_server/issues/48>`_ for a
discussion.

`IPywidgets server` lets you serve Jupyter widgets outside of a Jupyter
Notebook. Any Python callback defined on your widgets will work as in the
notebook.
